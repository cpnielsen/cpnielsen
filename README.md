Hi there! My name is Christian Palmhøj Nielsen and I work at [Famly](https://famly.co) as a Lead Developer focusing on the financial aspects of the product - purchases, invoices, payments and more.

As part of my job and my spare time I also tinker with database and data processing in general, building infrastructure with kubernetes and trying to
constantly re-engineer things to be easier to maintain and more performant (in the best way, I promise!)

    You have a problem. You think to yourself: I'll solve this using kubernetes!

    You now have 17 problems (at least)...

You can find me as [@cpnielsen](https://twitter.com/cpnielsen) on ![twitter](https://i.imgur.com/wWzX9uB.png) twitter.
